## Description

My motivation for this project was to create a portfolio page to showcase the projects that I've worked on
as well as provide some information about myself as a burgeoning web developer. I crafted this portfolio
so that potential employers can view my past work and use the contact information provided in the "Contact Me"
section to contact me further. Previous to this project, I did not have a portfolio and it is important for web 
developers to have a portfolio to present their best work to potential employers and clients alike. Throughout
the process of building this project, I learned a number of things. I was able to gain a better understanding
of Flexbox and media queries, as well as how the implementation of small features (hover effects and styling) 
can really make a webpage feel more alive and visually interesting.
